# 🤖 AJCBots  
### Animal Jam Classic Socket Bots

AJCBots is a socket-based bot framework for **Animal Jam Classic**, intended for developers and researchers who require low-level access to the game’s network protocol.

This project enables direct communication with the game servers without the official client, allowing for automation, testing, and protocol research.

## 🔌 Overview

AJCBots connects to Animal Jam Classic servers using raw socket connections, providing full control over packet handling and client behavior.

The project is designed for advanced use cases where direct packet interaction is required.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

- The use of socket bots may violate **Animal Jam Classic’s Terms of Service**.
- Improper or excessive use can result in:
  - **Account bans**
  - **IP bans**
- **Not all accounts will successfully connect or function**. Failures may occur due to unstable or faulty servers, rate limiting, or the use of unreliable or blocked proxy services.
- **This program is not proxied by default and will use your IP address** until add your own proxy provider to Controller.js and Extra.js (I recommend a rotating residental proxy)
